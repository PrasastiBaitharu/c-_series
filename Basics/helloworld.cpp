//Namespace = provides a solution for preventing name conflicts in large projects. Each entity needs a unique name. A namespace allow for identically named entities as long as the namespace are different.
//A namespace is a container that groups related identifiers (like variables, functions, classes, etc.) together to avoid name conflicts.
//is used to tell the compiler that you want to use all the names (like functions, classes, and objects) that are defined in the std (standard) namespace without writing std:: before them.
